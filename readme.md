Wake up. Go to work. Do work. Get fired.
Wake up. Go to work. Do work. Get fired.
Wake up. Go to work. Do work. Get fired.

This is the Loop of our society. Mindless work each day, just for a system that controls our lives. You would think it would drive you insane.

- Click Button
- Click Other Button
- Chase Button
- Give Up
