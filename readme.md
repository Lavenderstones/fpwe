Wake up. Go to work. Do work. Get fired.
Wake up. Go to work. Do work. Get fired.
Wake up. Go to work. Do work. Get fired.

This is the Loop of our society. Mindless work each day, just for a system that controls our lives. You would think it would drive you insane.

Fast Paced Working Environment is about exactly this - a part-comedic social commentary with psychological horror elements, and mild amounts of gameplay such as:
- Click Button
- Click Other Button
- Chase Button
- Give Up
